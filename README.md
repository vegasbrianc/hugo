This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installation with the [Hugo Base Template](https://github.com/crakjie/hugo-base-theme) installed and configured for http://localhost

The goal of this project is to turn a Hugo site into a Continous Delivery Docker template which generates a new Docker container everytime posting new content.
